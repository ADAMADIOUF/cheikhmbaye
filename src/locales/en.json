    "description": "My name is Cheikh Mbaye and I have always worked in the artisanal tradition with respect for art and African craftsmanship. Awa Gueye Couture draws its strength from multiculturalism. The designer loves traveling, discoveries, and nature. The collections are partly inspired by my journeys and encounters. I am attentive to my clients and take pleasure in surprising them by presenting creations that align with my convictions: elaborately crafted garments made with fine fabrics, derived from natural materials often reworked and embroidered. Since my early days working alongside a master couturier, I have always embraced the purest tradition of 'Haute Couture' and cater to anyone seeking elegance and exceptional quality. Drawing inspiration from the depths of world cultures, Cheikh Mbaye has become an indispensable figure in Senegalese and African fashion. Highly acclaimed by the fashion industry, Awa Gueye Couture has successfully captivated an international clientele through its choice of materials, glamour, softness, and attention to detail."
